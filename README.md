# Multiplayer Pong Game

Welcome to the repository of my **Multiplayer Pong Game**! This game is built using **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **Express**, creating an engaging local multiplayer experience. It's designed for two players to enjoy the classic pong game with a modern twist.

In this repository, you'll find all the source code, as well as a demonstration video to give you a glimpse of the gameplay. To try the game yourself, simply clone this repo and follow the instructions to get started.
